Percussive organ sample player for KORG Minilogue XD / Prologue synthesizers
(C) hammondeggs 2019

Using a simple sample based player, now you can create some new and old school inspired sounds with your Korg Minilogue-XD and Prologue synthesizers. 

# As always, especially with the Korg user oscillators, these are to be used at your own risk!


This is a uniquely generated sample set (the lower octaves use a unique sample to help avoid some aliasing), and if you wish to generate your own in VCV, a save-file is even provided (*again use at ones own risk*). 

This save file currently requires in addition to the Fundamental modules:
- Befaco Even VCO (0.6.0)
- Vult Free Stabile and Lateralus filters (0.6.24)
- Bog Audio ADDITATOR and MIX8 (0.6.12)

*Greater software versions are likely to work but are untested.*


#
### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue/prologue sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER OSCILLATORS tab on the librarian, and drag and drop the requisite file to an available slot in the librarian :
 - for Minilogue xd users, please use percy.mnlgxdunit
 - for Prologue users, please use percy.prlgunit

You should now see Percy V1.00-0 listed in your user oscillators. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

#
### usage

The organ sound is pretty self explanatory, however as of V1.00-0 there are two user parameters:

- Shape Knob : Sets the amount of a logarithmic style portamento. This is best suited using mono mode.
- Shift+Shape knob : Sets the amount of overdrive to apply to the base oscillator sound. Note, this is not an 'overall' overdrive, this is done *per oscillator*.

Step 3: Enjoy!
